Changed to a React WebApp so first need to install NPM as a package manager.

Then need to run:

npm i react-leaflet leaflet @types/react-leaflet

How to Edit:
1. Edit the files in Src (e.g. App.tsx)
2. Run npm start to run the app. 
3. Should open localhost:3000 automatically but if not navigate it in browser.
