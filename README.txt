Changed to a React WebApp so first need to install NPM as a package manager.

Then need to run:

npm i react-leaflet leaflet @types/react-leaflet
npm add material-ui/core

File Format:
The public folder is assets used for the frontend.
All logic files are in the src folder.
/compotents folder contains all react compotents displayed on screen.
/backend/src/main is the java implementation of the backend for the application.
/backend/src/test is the source for the unit and integration testing



How to Run:
1. Navigate to the base installation folder.
2. Run npm start
3. Should open localhost:3000 automatically but if not navigate to it in browser.
